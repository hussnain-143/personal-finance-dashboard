# Finance Tracker

A React-based web application to track income, expenses, budgets, and financial goals, using React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

To get started, first clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/hussnain-143/personal-finance-dashboard.git
cd personal-finance-dashboard

Then install the dependencies:
npm install

Initialize Tailwind CSS (if not already configured):
npx tailwindcss init

Run the app:
npm start

Features of the application include:
- Dashboard with financial overview
- Transaction management (add, edit, delete transactions)
- Budget planning and tracking
- Financial goal setting and progress tracking
- Reports with pie and line charts
- Mock authentication using localStorage

Dependencies used in this project:
- React
- React Router DOM
- Redux Toolkit
- Chart.js
- Tailwind CSS

Make sure Tailwind CSS is properly set up in tailwind.config.js and the CSS file is imported in your main entry file (e.g., main.jsx or index.js). Chart.js should also be configured in the components that display graphs.
